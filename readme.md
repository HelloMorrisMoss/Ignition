# Ignition SCADA

## What is Ignition?

It's a system created by Inductive Automation for controlling and collecting data from industrial processes.

## What is in this repo?

Code I've written for use with Ignition. Many are convenience functions or wrappers.

## Highlights

* Psuedo-tag: for a cleaner, more object-oriented style to interact with a tag.
* PyDataList: for working on DataSets as Python lists, with many extras.
* utils: many small convenience functions.
